<h1>Developing a Website for a Climate Change Company From Scratch</h1>
<p>I loved the result of this project. In a multi-stage process, I researched design trends in the climate technology industry then emulated them with HTML and CSS. I got to use <b>flexbox</b>, <b>grid</b>, and many other approaches to recreate the "look and feel" of climate change companies using code from scratch.</p>

<h2>Showcase of Prototype</h2>

<b>Header and Diptych</b>. The landing page is designed to be high-impact, working alongside the image to give a sense of space and possibility. The effect supports the company's position as an innovative company and is a breath of fresh air.

<b>Call-to-Action and Articles</b>. Afterwards, there is a call-to-action section, and below that there is a new section designed for articles. Using grid to present them side-by-side was a lot of fun and an exciting challenge.

<b>Final Call-to-Action and Footer</b>. I'm particularily happy with the footer. Building a footer that looks and works right can be a tricky process, as it's easy for the lack of content to create a low-energy section of the website or for it to look out of place.

<b>Reference</b>. Finally, I'm happy that my website looks similar to many of the ones used for inspiration and reference. As they say, detail is king: I focused on hover states, a clean header, and colors to re-create that climate company look in a detailed way.
